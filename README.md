# AB_TESTING

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
A company uses two bidding strategies offered by Facebook:
Maximum Bidding
Average Bidding
The company wants to understand which bidding strategy generates a higher conversion rate.
The conversion rate is measured using the purchase metric (number of products purchased after clicking ads)

ðŸ§© Methodology
Data: Provided by the company for both bidding strategies
Control Group:  Maximum Bidding
Test Group: Average Bidding

Analysis:
Test statistical assumptions (normality & homogeneity of variances)
Conduct an Independent Samples t-test
Compare the mean purchase values of the groups

ðŸ“Š Key Objective
To test the hypothesis:
H0: There is no difference in purchase performance between bidding strategies
H1: There is a significant difference in purchase performance between bidding strategies
